# Security Considerations

## Smart Contract Security

### Access Control
- NGO withdrawal functions are protected by `onlyOwner` modifier
- Only authorized wallet can withdraw funds
- Multi-signature wallet recommended for production

### Input Validation
- All donation amounts validated for positive values
- String inputs sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- Maximum donation limits can be implemented

### Reentrancy Protection
- Uses OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` pattern
- State changes occur before external calls
- PYUSD transfers use safe transfer methods

### Audit Recommendations
- [ ] Third-party security audit before mainnet deployment
- [ ] Formal verification of critical functions
- [ ] Bug bounty program for community testing

## Frontend Security

### Wallet Connection
- Uses RainbowKit for secure wallet integration
- Private keys never exposed to frontend
- Transaction signing handled by user's wallet

### Data Validation
- All user inputs validated client-side and contract-side
- XSS prevention through React's built-in protections
- CSP headers recommended for production deployment

## Privacy Considerations

### Donor Anonymity
- Only wallet addresses stored on-chain
- No personal information collected or stored
- IP address logging should be minimized

### Data Retention
- Blockchain data is immutable and permanent
- Consider privacy implications for sensitive causes
- Users should be informed about permanent record keeping

## Deployment Security

### Environment Variables
- Private keys stored securely (hardware wallets preferred)
- RPC endpoints use authenticated connections
- API keys rotated regularly

### Infrastructure
- HTTPS enforcement for all connections
- Regular dependency updates
- Monitoring for suspicious transactions

## Compliance

### KYC/AML Considerations
- Platform provides pseudonymity, not full anonymity
- NGOs responsible for regulatory compliance
- Consider jurisdiction-specific requirements

### Legal Framework
- Terms of service defining platform responsibilities
- Privacy policy explaining data handling
- Regulatory compliance varies by jurisdiction
